        <h2>Planning your project</H2>
        <p>Planning is an essential part of developing a game. How much planning you do in advance depends on the volume of your project. If you are developing a small amd simple game on your own you might not need as much planning as if your working on a bigger project with a team. </p>
        <p>Proper planning helps you to not get lost during your project.</p>
        <p>Here are a few things you should keep in mind while planning:</p>
        <p>Elevator pitch: A description of the core concept of your game and what makes it interesting. This should not be longer than a few sentences.</p>
        <p>Tool: What engine are you using, what software for graphics etc.</p>
        <p>Scope: How long should the game be? How many levels and what kind of levels.</p>
        <p>Pillars: The pillars of your game are the 2 to 3 most important features/themes/main goals of your game. During developement you're going to come back to these to make more consistent and coherent desicions.</p>
        <p>Experience goals: How should the player react to certain aspects or feel in certain situations of the game? Being specific with your goals help. The goals don't have to be complicated and should be clear. Imagining the players perspective helps. Your experience goals should somehow contribute to the main pillars.</p>
        <p>Mechanics: Mechanics are activities, systems or tactics that are frequently repeated in the game. I.e. Jumping and running or running and shooting. Core mechanics are the most frequent while secondary mechanics add more variety. Mechanics and levels depend on each other. You can't build a level without knowing the mechanics but you don't know if the mechanics work without testing them in a level.</p>
