            <h2>Level Design</h2>
            <h3>Pre-production</h3>
            <p>Now that you have planned the core of your game it is time to take on the levels. </p>
            <p>There are a lot of different types of levels:</p>
            <li>Clearly marked levels (i.e. Candy Crush)</li>
            <li>Player levels (i.e. Genshin Impact)</li>
            <li>Skill levels (i.e. Stardew Valley)</li>
            <li>Boss fights (i.e. Elden Ring)</li>
            <li>Different Maps (i.e. Valorant)</li>
            <p>Can you think of more examples?</p>

            <p>"Level design is the practice of planning and building spaces for video games" <i>The Level Design Book
                    &#0185;</i></p>
            <p>An important thought when building your levels is how you're going to lead the player to do specific
                things. <br> In order to do that you have to know what the goal of the level is. Is the player supposed
                to find a collectible? Are they supposed to meet an NPC? Define your goals and then think about how you
                get the player to achieve them.</p>
            <h3>In the process the information below can help you to define your goals:</h3>
            <h4>Experience goals</h4>
            <p>While planning your game you have defined some experience goals you want to achieve. <br> Build your
                level in a way that contributes to that. </p>
            <h4>Pacing</h4>
            <p>Pacing is the general order and rhythm of activities and events in a level. This can also be used to
                shape the experience. Do you want to make the player feel stressed in a certain level? Make a lot of
                things happen in a short amount of time or set a time limit for a task.</p>
            <h4>Hierarchy</h4>
            <p>Which parts of the level are the most important?</p>
            <h4>Causality</h4>
            <p>Why does the player do this before that?</p>
            <h4>Information</h4>
            <p>What do you tell the player and when?</p>
            <h4>Intensity</h4>
            <p>When should the player pay more attention and when do they rest and recover?</p>

            <h3>Mission Design</h3>
            <p>Mission Design is often confused with level design. They are different though. One level can contain
                multiple missions.</p>
            <p>If you want to level up your character you first need to collect the neccessary items. These might be
                obtained through combat or exporing. When the player completed all missions neccessary they can complete
                the level.</p>
            <video controls autoplay muted loop src="../img/dbdMissions.mp4" ></video>
            <p><i>Dead by Daylight - BHVR Interactive, 2016 </i></p>
            <p>In the game "Dead by Daylight" the goal of the level is to escape the level through the exit gates on the map. In order to achieve that goal the players have to complete multiple missions first. They have to repair generators, unhook their team mates, heal each other, distract the killer and open the exit gates. The level goal can not be achieved without completing the missions.</p>

                contest for students. On the website you can find the briefings for the different categories and what
                the winners ended up doing. This can help you to get a feeling for tasks that you might get in the
                industry. </p>

            <h3>Layout</h3>
            <p>When you are done planning your level you can start with the layout. The layout is the basic structure of
                the level. To visualize this, a 2D skech from above is usually used. </p>

            <p>Create a Layout for a level in your game.</p>
            <h4>Flow</h4>
            <p>The flow is the way a player moves through a level. The best flow is whatever supports the intended
                design
                goals. This involves parameters like the speed at which a player can move, the direction (Is the path
                straight or curvy etc.), wayfinding (does the player have to find their way or is it clearly marked?)
                and metrics (What are the movement mechanics?).</p>
            <h4>Desire Lines and Critical pathing</h4>
            <p>The desire line is tha path that a player intuitively wants to take through a level. Often times these
                are the shortest paths to a specific destination. If these are blocked by something it might feel
                frustrating to the player because taking the longer way can feel like a waste of time. You can also use
                this as a tool to achieve your experience goals. </p>
            <p>The critical path is the minimum/main path to complete a level. This is the minimum distance the player
                has to cover to successfully go through the level.</p>
