            <h2>Storytelling and Narrative Design</h2>
            <p>As the name suggestest this chapter is about how to tell your story and how to integrate it into your
                game.</p>
            <p>In some games the story is more prominent than in others. There are games in which the story is an
                integral part of the game. If you look at games like "Life is strange" or "Detroit become human" the
                player even helps to decide how the story ends. When you think about games like chess you don't really
                think about the story, but even here you have the story of to opposing kingdoms fighting in a war. This
                story might not influence the way you play, but it is definitely there.&#0185; </p>
            <h3>The hero's journey</h3>
            <p>The hero's journey is the base of most stories. It has twelve steps that describe how the story
                progresses. Some steps may be repeated or left out depending on your story, but it is a good guideline
                for storytelling.</p>
            <p>Research the hero's journey and see how your story idea fits into that pattern. Maybe this will help you
                to find new chapters you could add to your story. </p>
            <p>Another thing explained in this theory are the archetypes. The archetypes are different roles the
                characters can play. They might be helpful for better understanding your characters and their motives.

                journey</a>
            <p>"A good story shows connections and with that establishes meaning."&#0178; </p>
            <p>With that Adamczyk is saying, that storytelling is showing connections between certain events and through
                that making them interesting.</p>
            <h3>Narrative Design</h3>
            <p>Now that you know what story you want to tell, it's time to decide how you want to tell it. How will the
                player experience and discover your story?</p>
            <p>"As a narrative designer you take plot and turn it into gameplay." &#0179;</p>
            <p>There are a lot of options to tell your story and you can be very creative with that. To help you get an
                idea here are some examples:</p>
            <li>Have a narrator tell the story. (i.e. Little Misfortune, Baldurs Gate, Stanley Parable)</li>
            <li>Let the player find diary entries/journal pages/letters etc. (i.e. What remains of Edith Finch)</li>
            <li>Another character (NPC) tells the story.(i.e. Glados and Wesley in Portal)</li>
            <li>Make cutscenes to progress the story. (i.e. Bokura)</li>
            <p>You can look at some more games to find more ways to tell the story.</p>
