            <h2>Planning your project</H2>
            <p>Planning is an essential part of developing a game. How much planning you do in advance depends on the
                volume of your project. If you are developing a small amd simple game on your own you might not need as
                much planning as if your working on a bigger project with a team. </p>
            <p>Proper planning helps you to not get lost during your project.</p>
            <p>Here are a few things you should keep in mind while planning:</p>
            <p>Elevator pitch: A description of the core concept of your game and what makes it interesting. This should
                not be longer than a few sentences.</p>
            <p>Tool: What engine are you using, what software for graphics etc.</p>
            <p>Scope: How long should the game be? How many levels and what kind of levels.</p>
            <p>Pillars: The pillars of your game are the 2 to 3 most important features/themes/main goals of your game.
                During developement you're going to come back to these to make more consistent and coherent desicions.
            </p>
            <p>Experience goals: How should the player react to certain aspects or feel in certain situations of the
                game? Being specific with your goals help. The goals don't have to be complicated and should be clear.
                Imagining the players perspective helps. Your experience goals should somehow contribute to the main
                pillars.</p>
            <p>Mechanics: Mechanics are activities, systems or tactics that are frequently repeated in the game. I.e.
                Jumping and running or running and shooting. Core mechanics are the most frequent while secondary
                mechanics add more variety. Mechanics and levels depend on each other. You can't build a level without
                knowing the mechanics but you don't know if the mechanics work without testing them in a level.</p>
            <p>Remember that there is no right or wrong way to go about this. You have to find out what works best for
                you and your team. There aren't really set rules for game design. Only guidelines that are there to help
                you in your process.</p>
            <h2>Worldbuilding</h2>
            <p>Worldbuilding is the high level conceptual process of designing the setting and history of the fictional
                game world.&#0185 </p>
            <p>This process includes deciding on things like the worlds climate, political histories, biomes, routines
                etc.</p>
            <p>At the same time you should only discuss things that play an important roll in your game. It wouldn't
                neccessarily make sense to plan out a whole family tree for a monarch family if you're making a racing
                game.</p>
            <p>You should plan ahead as much stuff as you need to be able to ensure a smooth production process. At the
                same time you shouldn't go into too much detail in order to stay flexible.</p>
            <p>Worldbuilding can also help to solve design or thechnical problems you might encounter in the process.
                "Is the player moveing through repetitive corridors and shooting squares, or is the player escaping an
                alien ivasion of a vast underground military complex?" "Is the monster unable to navigate water due to
                broken pathfinding AI, or is the monster afraid of water?".</p>
            <p>If you feel lost and overwhelmed just go back to the basic worldbuilding questions:</p>
            <li>Who made this place?</li>
            <li>Who lives here now?</li>
            <li>How can the player affect this place?</li>
            <h2>Points to plan</h2>
            <li>Maps</li>
