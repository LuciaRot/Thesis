            <h2>Sound Design</h2>
            <p>"Sound design is the art of creating and shaping sounds for a particular purpose." <i>Native Instruments</i>&#0185;</p>
            <p>Sound design includes not only the soundtrack of a game, but also the dialogue of a game and all the sound effects that happen throughout it. This includes things like footsteps, sounds for opening doors, drawers, chests etc., mob sounds and much more. </p>
            <p>Try playing a game with the sound turned completely off. What do you notice? Does it take away from the experience?</p>
            <p>Now play a game with the sound turned on. Make a list of every sound you hear and when you hear it.</p>
            <p>Take a second and listen to the environment around you? What do you hear? Can you make out where every sound is coming from?</p>
            <p>Use this to create the sound atmosphere of your game. Maybe the scene takes place on a street in a city. What would you hear? Cars driving by, footsteps from people walking around you, maybe there's a restaurant nearby so you hear the sound of dishes and people talking. And like that you can create a picture in the players mind with only sounds.</p>
            <p>Sound design contributes to the realism of the game - <a href="Chapter_6.html">Immersion</a> <br>It creates emotions in the player. The absense of sound can create an unsetteling feeling.</p>
            <p>There are a few free sound libraries where you can get sound effects, but always check the terms and conditions on how you are allowed to use them. If you are planning on diving deeper into sound design you might want to start your own library and start recording sounds yourself. This also gives you the opportunity to get exactly the sounds you are looking for. </p>
