        <h2>UX-/UI-Design</h2>
        <p>User Experience Design and User Interface Design work together hand in hand.</p>
        <p>While UI-Design is about what the Interface looks like, i.e. your pause menu or your HUD (Heads up Display). User Experience Design, as the name suggests, is more about how the user experiences that Interface. Is it easy to understand? Does a specific design awake the desire to click on a button or scroll some more?</p>
        <p>Keeping this in mind you have to design your interface in a way that portraits your desired experience.</p>
        <p>"Products not only have to be functional, but should also give the user a positive and satisfactory experience." <i>Donald Norman</i>&#0185;</p>
        <p>Check out the 10 Laws of User Experience Design <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/laws-of-ux/9781098169046/xhtml/Contents_9783960108665.xhtml"></a>Laws of UX - by Jon Yablonski</p>
        <p>Sometimes knowing what you don't want helps you define the things you actually want.</p>
        <p>Have you ever played a game where you couldn't see your crosshair because it was too light in front of the background of the game? <br>Or have you ever looked for a specific setting but you couldn't find it, because there were to many options?</p>
        <p>Your job is to find a solution for problems like that. Create a list of things you want the player to be able to do and what you might want to avoid and then see how you can accomplish theses things.</p>
        <p>Referencing other games for inspiration can always help (Jakob's Law - see above).</p>
        <p>The game "Valorant" for example combats the first mentioned problem by giving the player the option to create their own crosshair or copy the crosshair of other players.</p>
        <p>Below you can find some more examples of User Interfaces in games and how they might change the User Experience.</p>
