            <p>"The goal of an interface is to make players feel in control of their experience." <i>Jesse Schell
                    &#0185;</i></p>
            <p>User Experience Design and User Interface Design work together hand in hand.</p>
            <p>While UI-Design is about what the Interface looks like, i.e. your pause menu or your HUD (Heads up
                Display), User Experience Design, as the name suggests, is more about how the user experiences that
                Interface. Is it easy to understand? Does a specific design awake the desire to click on a button or
                scroll some more?</p>
            <p>Keeping this in mind you have to design your interface in a way that portraits your desired experience.
            </p>
            <p>"Products not only have to be functional, but should also give the user a positive and satisfactory
                experience." <i>Donald Norman</i>&#0178;;</p>
            <p>Check out the 10 Laws of User Experience Design <a class="reference" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/laws-of-ux/9781098169046/">Laws
                of UX - by Jon Yablonski</a></p>
            <p>In chapter 15 of his book "The Art of Game Design", Jesse Schell goes into detail about different
                interfaces and their connections between each other. <a class="reference"
                    href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-art-of/9781351803632/">The Art of Game
                    Design</a></p>
            <p>Sometimes knowing what you don't want helps you define the things you actually want.</p>
            <p>Have you ever played a game where you couldn't see your crosshair because it was too light in front of
                the background of the game? <br>Or have you ever looked for a specific setting but you couldn't find it,
                because there were to many options?</p>
            <p>Your job is to find a solution for problems like that. Create a list of things you want the player to be
                able to do and what you might want to avoid and then see how you can accomplish theses things.</p>
            <p>Referencing other games for inspiration can always help (Jakob's Law - see above).</p>
            <p>The game "Valorant" for example combats the first mentioned problem by giving the player the option to
                create their own crosshair or copy the crosshair of other players.</p>
            <p>Below you can find some more examples of User Interfaces in games and how they might change the User
                Experience.</p>

                <p>Dead by Daylight has a few accessibility settings to make the experience better for people who are
                    visually or hearing impared. </p>

                <p>In Phasmophobia you can decide if the temperature in game is shown in fahrenheit or celsius.</p>
