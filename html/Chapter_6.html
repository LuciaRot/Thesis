            <h2>Environmental Design</h2>
            <p>Environmental Design establishes the world visually. It includes Environment Art, so which style you're
                using, what color palette etc., but also where you place specific things. <br> This doesn't neccessarily
                include the key
                structures, because where you best place those is something you are going to test in the blockout
                process when designing your levels. It is more about where you place decorations and other assets like
                trees or plants to
                make the space feel alive.</p>
            <p>Level Design and Environmental Design work hand in hand. You can have a beautiful world but if there are
                no
                challenges or tasks for the player, it's going to get boring real quick.</p>
            <p>Gaming environment can tell stories. <br> The player arrives at a cave, the floor is full of skeletons.
                What happened here? Maybe a monster lives in this cave. You could hint at that by placing footprints on
                the ground. Maybe a battle took place here. Are there weapons laying around? <br>With environmental
                design you can tell a story without actually saying a word.</p>
            <p>The environment can also help to show rules of the game. It could be as simple as a sign that says: No
                trespassing. It could also be little lightning animations on a fence to implicate that electricity runs
                through it and it shouldn't be touched.</p>
            <p>In his article "Environmental Storytelling: Creating Immersive 3D Worlds Using Lessons Learned from the
                Theme Park Industry" Don Carson talks about creating a world and how to draw people in and make them
                want to stay. He worked as a senior show designer for Walt Disney and helped design multiple attractions
                for Disney Land.&#0185;</p>
            <h2>Immersion</h2>
            <p>Immersion is the perception of being physically present in a non-physical world. This effect is created
                by different factors like images or sounds. <br> In the gaming world this means to transport the player
                into an alternative world and try to make them feel more like the character they're playing. <br>This
                can be achieved by making a game as coherent and consistent as possible. Players usually only notice
                when something is wrong or seems out of place and that can disturb the immersive experience.</p>
            <p>Have you ever had to critizise someones performance? It is easier to spot the mistakes than the things
                that that person did well. </p>
            <p>In his book <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-66908-2">"Immersive Virtuelle
                    Realität"</a> Matthias Wölfel talks about the basics of immersive experiences.</p> <br>
