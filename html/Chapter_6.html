            <h2>Environmental Design</h2>
            <p>Now that you have created the base of your leves and your world it is time to look into environmental design.</p>
            <p>Environmental Design establishes the world visually. It includes Environment art, so which style you're using, what color palette etc., but also where you place specific things. <br> This doesn't mean the key structures, because where you best place those is something you already tested and found out in tho blockout process. It is more about where you place decorations and other assets like trees or plants to make the space feel alive.</p>
            <p>Level Design and Environment Design work hand in hand. You can have a beautiful world but if there are no challenges or tasks for the player, it's going to get boring real quick.</p>
            <p>Gaming environment can tell stories. <br> The player arrives at a cave, the floor is full of skeletons. What happened here? Maybe a monster lives in this cave. You could hint at that by placing footprints on the ground. Maybe a battle took place here. Are there weapons laying around? <br>With environmental design you can tell a story without actually saying a word.</p>
            <p>The environment can also help to show rules of the game. It could be as simple as a sign that says: No trespassing. It could also be little lightning animations on a fence to implicate that electricity runs through it and it shouldn't be touched.</p>
            <p>In his article "Environmental Storytelling: Creating Immersive 3D Worlds Using Lessons Learned from the Theme Park Industry" Don Carson talks about creating a world and how to draw people in and make them want to stay. He worked as a senior show designer for Walt Disney and helped design multiple attractions for Disney Land.&#0185;</p>
            <h2>Immersion</h2>
            <p>Immersion is the perception of being physically present in a non-physical world. This effect is created by different factors like images or sounds. <br> In the gaming world this means to transport the player into an alternative world and try to make them feel more like the character they're playing. <br>This can be achieved by making a game as coherent and consistent as possible. Players usually only notice when something is wrong or seems out of place and that can disturb the immersive experience.</p>
            <p>Have you ever had to critizise someones performance? It is easier to spot the mistakes than the things that that person did well. </p>
            <p>In his book <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-66908-2">"Immersive Virtuelle Realität"</a>  Matthias Wölfel taks about the basics of immersive experiences.</p>
            <p>Lighting can guide the player.</p>
            <p>Lighting can also be an indicator for a change of states. If you look at Minecraft for example you know that during the night monsters will spawn. The same thing happens in dark spaces. This urges you too put lights into your base and wherever you want to feel safe. </p>
