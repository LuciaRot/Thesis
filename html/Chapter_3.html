            <h2>Mechanics</h2>
            <p>The mechanics are part of the skeleton of your game. </p>
            <p>There are core mechanics which are the most apparent, most used and most important mechanics in the
                game.</p>
            <p>There are also secondary mechanics that add to the core mechanics but aren't as important. Which ones
                these are totally depends on the game you're trying to make.</p>

            <p>If you want to make a jump and run game your core mechanics would be jumping and running. </p>
            <p>Check out Chapter 12 of The Art of Games Design by Jesse Schell to see how he categorizes mechanics.</p>
            <h3>Rules</h3>
            <p>One of the most fundamental mechanics in your game is rules. They define the course of action. What can
                the player do? What is he supposed to do?</p>
            <p>

                Another important question is how these rules are enforced. Here are a few examples:
            </p>
            <li>Fall damage: <p style="display: inline;">You don't want the player to be able to jump down from every
                    hight</p>
            </li>
            <li>Restricting movement: <p style="display: inline;"> You decide how high/far the character can jump, how
                    fast they can run etc.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Restricting access: <p style="display: inline;">Don't want the player to enter a certeain building?
                    Ensure the door wont open. Maybe they first need a key for it. </p>
            </li>
            <p>Think of more examples and define the rules for your game. </p>
            <p>Depending on the type of rule you might have to explain it to the player. If you're making a boardgame
                for example there is no way for the player to know how it works. <br>Tutorials are created for that
                reason. </p> <br>
